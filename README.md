Just playing with some ML algorithms
  Logistic Regression (LR)
  Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
  K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
  Classification and Regression Trees (CART).
  Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB).
  Support Vector Machines (SVM).
  
  Followed along with: https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/
  
  went off on my own exploration from there.
